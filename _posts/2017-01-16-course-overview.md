The ATLAS Capstone 1 class lays the foundation for the culminating work in the TAM major. In this course, students will research precedents and domains for further project development, teach effective design processes and presentation skills, and engage in iterative making and critique of each other’s work.

<br>

Although you may look at this document and think [tl;dr](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr), ***read the whole thing***! We’ve thought carefully about all of this, and have worked hard to give you both independence and support throughout your Capstone process. The rationales, requirements, milestones and consequences are clearly stated in this document.

<br>

# Objectives
Students who successfully complete this course will:

<br>

#### Critical Thinking & Theory / History (CT):
+ Improve vocabulary and critical thinking in order to discuss their work
+ Develop a robust understanding of existing work in their field of interest

#### Design/Creative (DC):
+ Refine their design process

#### Technical (T):
+ Improve their iteration techniques to build better work
+ Cultivate their prototyping skills
+ Asses technical needs for current or further pursuit


<br>

# Class Meetings
Each Capstone section meets as a group once per week, for 3h 50m. This time will be used for lectures, group exercises, critiques, discussions, one-on-one checkins and more. Often times, this class period will be used for individual work time, but <span class="underlined">**it is mandatory that you attend class for the full duration of this session**</span>. Every single week you should be prepared with something to work on during class.

<br>

If you take advantage of class time well, you will be able to do a large portion of your Capstone work during the scheduled meeting times. Remember, Capstone is just one class. It is not meant to take over and ruin every other aspect of your life, but if you fail to prioritize consistent work time, your projects (and grade) will suffer. A major objective of this process is for you to learn how to budget and schedule your time and energy over a long term project.

<br>

There will be time reserved for one-on-one discussions with your Instructor during class. You are also highly  encouraged to set up additional individual appointment as needed.  

<br>

# Communication

We will have a slack channel for this course - this is an easy way for you to communicate with your classmates and with me (I am usually quicker to respond there than via email).

<br>

You must use your colorado.edu email account for this course - all class correspondence must go through this address.

<br>

Assignment submissions, discussions, and grading will use the **Canvas** course tools system.


<br>

# Attendance
Because Capstone only meets once each week, it is absolutely mandatory that you are present and prepared for each class. **Missing more than 2 classes is a cause for failure.**

<br>

Critiques are a very important part of the design process and a fundamental part of this course. Even if your project is not fully completed, **it is absolutely mandatory that you attend every critique and provide feedback to your peers**. It will affect your grade negatively if you do not show up for critique. Work is expected to be completed prior to the critique, do not attempt to finish your project during critique, have everything you need uploaded, tested and ready. Student computers and phones must be put away and full participation is expected.

<br>


# Evaluation
The focus of Capstone is project development, and the course has been designed to give you both a lot of support and a lot of independence.

<!-- Once we get into the individual project portion of the course, since each of you will have a different project, with different internal timelines and needs, you will make up your own production schedule and assignments. I may make additional assignments or require additional readings for you as well. Essentially the assignment every week is Advance Your Project (AYP). That is, an assignment may say ‘prepare a presentation’, and you must do that, but don’t stop working on your actual project: AYP! -->

<br>

Your Capstone project is largely self-directed, but there are a few mandatory milestones.

|---|---|---|
|  *Week 4*     | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Portfolio    | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | 15 pts |
|  *Week 8*     | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Case Studies             | | 30 pts |
|  *Week 8*     | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Case Study Presentation  | | &nbsp; 5 pts |
|  *Week 10-12* | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Prototypes (3)           | | 30 pts |
|  *Week 12*    | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Prototype Presentation   | | &nbsp; 5 pts |
|  *Week 15*    | &nbsp;&nbsp;|Capstone 2 Proposal      | | 15 pts |

You will not be permitted to move onto Capstone 2 unless your proposal is approved by the faculty. You must earn at least a C in order to receive TAM credit for this course.


<br>

# Documentation
Ongoing documentation of your research, your design and production processes, testing, and methodology is a major part of your Capstone project. You are expected to post regularly as the semester progresses. Your weekly posts should include images, drawings, graphics, code snippets, videos, etc. in addition to a well written description of your work. It is intended to be a resource for *YOU* – a record and reflection of your process, your thinking, your insights. I promise you it will be useful for you to look back on!! I expect you to spend careful time cultivating this online journal, logging ideas and notes. Each post does not need to be especially formal, it should, however, be thoughtful.

<br>

At the end of the semester, you must comprehensively document your progress up to this point. You will create a proposal for your continued work in Capstone 2. You must prove that you are prepared for the next step of this process, and that you have done significant research and preparation to warrant you moving on.

<br>


# Project Requirements
+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of research**</span>. This includes knowing the field, alternative, previous and current approaches, your audience, how is your project different from other similar things, what are your influences.
+ <span class="underlined">**Cite your research sources.**</span> Wikipedia is kind of a starter resource, a pointer to more primary sources, which you need to seek out and cite. Develop a list of books/articles to read, inspirational projects, experimental work, installations to see, etc.
+ <span class="underlined">**Plagiarism…not allowed!**</span> Be sure to cite the sources of your research. That includes code. For example, if you have dropped in some code from Tom Igoe’s book or class, cite that too. Using work without attribution is not just stealing, it’s leaving the impression that you did all the work.
+ <span class="underlined">**Process documentation on your Capstone Journal throughout**</span>. At a minimum, you must write one post per week.
+ <span class="underlined">**Evidence of user testing and feedback**</span> once the idea is far enough along to solicit meaningful feedback.
+ <span class="underlined">**Consideration of user experience.**</span> At the end of the semester, you must be able to show a demonstration prototype that incorporates lessions learned through user test the project multiple times throughout the semester.
+ <span class="underlined">**Any outside help must be approved in advance.**</span> This includes material assistance on the development of your project outside of class (i.e. design, programming, production). If you need support for an element or two, that’s ok, but at least 80% of the work must be your own.

## UNIVERSITY POLICIES
A full list of CU’s academic policies can be found online at [colorado.edu/policies](http://www.colorado.edu/policies).

## Honor Code
All work/ideas/code must be original and created for this class. All code should be written from scratch by you - meaning that although some code is repeatable you should never copy and paste code from other sources and then find and replace your content into it.

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating, plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery, and threatening behavior. All incidents of academic misconduct shall be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu; 303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion). The [Student Honor Code](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-honor-code-policy) can be found online.

If you fail to meet a guideline by accident, we’ll discuss the situation without taking it to the Honor Council. But if I discover willful intent on your part, I’m obligated to report that to the Honor Council, which has the authority to enforce non-academic corrective action. I retain the authority to enforce academic sanctions, which will range from an F on the project to an F in the course, depending on the severity of the breach of trust.

## Classroom Behavior
Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, color, culture, religion, creed, politics, veteran’s status, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, and gender expression, age, disability, and nationalities. Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the student’s legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate changes to my records. Full details about the University's policy on [Student Classroom and Course-Related Behavior](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/student-classroom-and-course-related-behavior) can be found online.

## Accommodation For Disabilities
If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please submit to me a letter from Disability Services in a timely manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability Services determines accommodations based on documented disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or injury, see [Temporary Medical Conditions](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/students/temporary-medical-conditions). For additional information visit the [Disability Services](https://www.colorado.edu/disabilityservices/) website and discuss your needs with your professor.

## Religious Rights
Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who, because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams, assignments or required attendance. More information can be found online about the University policy regarding the [Observance of Religious Holidays](https://www.colorado.edu/policies/observance-religious-holidays-and-absences-classes-andor-exams). If you will be missing any classes in order to observe religious holidays, please inform your instructor of these dates at the beginning of the semester.
